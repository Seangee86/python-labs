 There's 365 days in one year. 60 mins in one hour. 60 seconds in one minute. 
 
60 seconds in one minute. 60sec * 60min = 3,600 seconds. So there's 3,600 seconds in 1 hour. 

24 hours in 1 day 

3,600sec * 24hours = 86,400 seconds in one day 

86,400sec  * 365days  = 31,536,000 seconds in one year. Not counting leap year
